# Simple TCP Proxy

A lightweight, high-performance TCP proxy developed as a personal project. This tool is being built to handle generic TCP connections, focusing on concurrency, reliability, and advanced features like TLS handling and traffic management.

---

## Overview

This project is a multi-phased effort to create a production-ready proxy. Key features include:

- Bidirectional data forwarding.
- Dedicated Command-Line Interface (CLI) for visibility and management.
- Transition to an asynchronous (async) architecture for high performance.
- Support for TLS termination and traffic throttling (rate limiting).

The complete development roadmap is detailed in the separate file: [development_plan](/doc/plan.md)
